        <h3 class="bluebox one">5 good reasons to use CodeWriters</h3>
        <p> Use Codewriters for 1-2 days
          to find exactly the developer, 
          with the right profile and compentencies
          that you need</p>
      </div>
      <div class="second">
        <h3 class="orangebox one">5x your developers efficiency</h3>
        <p> Developers get paid per ticket they finish
          so they will always have an incentive to be as 
          effective as possible</p>
      </div>
      <div class="thrid">
        <h3 class="bluebox two">Save on costs</h3>
        <p> No need to pay a monthly salary as 
          the developer is only paid per 
          ticket they finish</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourth">
        <h3 class="orangebox two">Keep in regular touch with the developer for years</h3>
        <p> Developers are working in their own setup
          making them more likely to continue working 
          for you in the long run</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fifth">
        <h3 class="bluebox three">There's no one like us</h3>
        <p>So why are we different from other platforms? Because at Codewriters, we 
          only have developers from Denmark. So, we have the developers that 
          companies want to hire. Other platforms offer developers from India, Eastern 
          Europe, South America, etc. We are not a platform you use to solve an 
          occasional peripheral task; anyone can do that. We should be used in a daily 
          setup for companies' core development. That's where we really come in and 
          streamline things. A company with a team of 10 developers will actually only 
          need to use 3 developers through Codewriters to do the same work.</p>
